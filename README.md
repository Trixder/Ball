# 3D Unity Game â€“ School Project

This is a 3D game made in Unity where you control a rolling ball and try to make it through a series of obstacle-filled levels.

The game challenges players to guide a ball through floating platforms, and tricky jumps. Every level ramps up the difficulty with new layouts and mechanics. It's built around learning how to handle movement and balance.
