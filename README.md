# 3D Unity Game – School Project
This is a 3D platformer made in Unity where you control a rolling ball and try to make it through a series of obstacle-filled levels. The project served as a hands-on way to learn Unity’s engine, C# scripting, and level design within a 3D environment.

## Overview

The game challenges players to guide a ball through floating platforms, and tricky jumps. Every level ramps up the difficulty with new layouts and mechanics. It's built around learning how to handle movement and balance.
